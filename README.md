## Hi there, I'm Tamar 👋

I design and ship **AI Agents** and create **ready-to-use examples** that developers can clone, run, and build on.

Most of my work is hands-on — **real code**, **clear patterns**, and **lab-tested setups** for:
- AI Agents  
- Multi-agent systems  
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- Tool calling  
- Memory  
- Local and cloud **LLMs, VLMs, and SLMs** apps  

---

### 🧭 What I focus on
- Building AI Agents that **work in real-world scenarios**
- Delivering **ready-to-run examples**: `clone → install → run`
- Helping developers with **agent architecture and workflows**
- Exploring next-gen AI capabilities like **multi-agent systems** and **Agentic Apps**
