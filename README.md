## Hi there, I'm Tamar 👋

<!--
**tamar-perez/tamar-perez** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I design and ship AI Agents and create ready-to-use examples that developers can clone, run, and build on.

Most of my work is hands-on real code, clear patterns, and lab test setups for AI Agents, Multi-agent, RAG, tool calling, memory, and local and cloud LLMs, VLMs, SLMs Apps.

What I focus on

Building AI Agents that work in real-world scenarios
Delivering ready-to-run examples: clone → install → run
Helping developers with agent architecture and workflows
Exploring next-gen AI capabilities like multi-agent systems and Agentic App layers
